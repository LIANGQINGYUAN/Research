- Action research and design research:Van de Ven, Andrew H. Engaged scholarship: a guide for organizational and social research. Oxford University Press, 2007.From the Abstract:The relationship between theory and practice, research and action, is fundamental to all fields of applied social science. Should research findings and knowledge be useful for science, practice, and policy? If so, how should such research be designed, carried out and disseminated to achieve the twin goals of rigor and relevance? These challenges are particularly relevant in the applied areas of management and organization studies where there is a distinct responsibility for researchers to engage with the "real world". The author both presents the broad intellectual challenge of "engaged scholarship", and also sets out a framework and guidelines for carrying out soundly based and useful research for advancing both science and practice. The book both provides a manifesto for engaged scholarship in the social sciences, and a framework for research design and methodology.

- A good paper on Intrinsic Motivation is relevant to games and to Tom Zimmerman’s point on games~tools:Sid Davis and Susan Wiedenbeck, The mediating effects of intrinsic motivation, ease of use and usefulness perceptions on performance in first-time and subsequent computer users, Interacting with Computers 13, 2001, pp. 549-580.  
- TAM/UTAUT is a well-known theory quite relevant to tool usage:V. Venkatesh, M. Morris, G. Davis, and F. Davis, User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view, MIS Quarterly, Vol. 27, No. 3 (Sep., 2003), pp. 425-478. This paper introduced UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology), the follow-on bringing TAM together with several competing models of earlier times. Last time I checked (2009) it had over 1600 citations.
